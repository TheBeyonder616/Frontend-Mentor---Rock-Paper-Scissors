## My Process

I approached this project by focusing on creating a smooth and engaging user experience, leveraging React for dynamic gameplay and SCSS for a polished design. I prioritized accessibility and responsive design for a wide range of devices.

### Built With

- **React**: For building reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and code reliability.
- **SCSS**: For modular and maintainable styling.
- **Vite**: As a fast development and build tool.
- **LocalStorage**: To persist game scores and states across sessions.

### What I Learned

This project helped me enhance my skills in:

- **Dynamic State Management**: Managing game states effectively using React.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Implementing persistence for user scores.
- **Accessibility Features**: Adding ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for inclusivity.
- **Responsive Design**: Using SCSS to create layouts optimized for various screen sizes.

### Continued Development

Future enhancements include:

- **Extended Gameplay**: Adding more options like "Lizard" and "Spock" for advanced rules.
- **Animations**: Introducing smooth animations for move selection and result display.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allowing players to compete with friends online.
